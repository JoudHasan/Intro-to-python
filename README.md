# 🐍 Introduction to Python - Recipe App

## 📋 Objective

Build the command-line version of a Recipe App that takes advantage of Python’s object-oriented nature.

## 🎯 User Goals

Users should be able to:

- **Create and modify recipes** with ingredients, cooking time, and a difficulty parameter that is automatically calculated by the app.
- **Search for recipes** by specifying ingredients.
- **View detailed information** on each recipe, such as ingredients, cooking time, and difficulty level.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Create and manage recipes** on a locally hosted MySQL database.
- **Search by ingredients**: Users can search for recipes that contain specific ingredients.
- **Automatically calculated difficulty**: The app rates each recipe by its difficulty level.
- **Detailed recipe view**: Users can prompt the app to display details on each recipe, including ingredients, cooking time, and difficulty.

## 📂 Project Deliverables

Each stage of the project is broken down into exercises, located in the project repository.

### 📘 Exercise 1: Intro to Python Programming

- Installed Python on macOS, Windows, or Linux.
- Created and managed virtual environments.
- Used `pip` to install and manage packages.

### 📗 Exercise 2: Data Types in Python

- Used data types and methods to store recipes containing relevant data.
- Added multiple recipes to a linear data structure for organized storage.

### 📙 Exercise 3: Functions and Other Operations in Python

- Implemented conditional statements to control program flow.
- Used loops to optimize coding efficiency.
- Defined functions to organize code effectively.

### 📕 Exercise 4: File Handling in Python

- Used files to store and retrieve recipe data.

### 📔 Exercise 5: Object-Oriented Programming in Python

- Applied object-oriented programming principles to design the Recipe app.

### 📓 Exercise 6: Databases in Python

- Created a MySQL database to store recipe data for the Recipe app.

### 📒 Exercise 7: Object-Relational Mapping in Python

- Interacted with a MySQL database using an object-relational mapper (ORM).
- Built the final command-line Recipe application with a user-friendly interface.
